# [Trakmos](https:/trakmos.app)

Trakmos allows cosmos magic tokens holder to view all their balances via a simple UI that either connects to one Keplr account of a simple text input.

Try it out at [trakmos.app](https://trakmos.app/).

## Disclaimer

The initial version of Trakmos was built quickly. I'm personally not a React or Javascript developer, and this project leans extremely heavily on the [CosmJS project](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs) and other fantastic codebases like [Keplr Wallet](https://github.com/chainapsis/keplr-wallet), [Osmosis Zone frontend](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis-frontend) and [ Restake.app](https://github.com/eco-stake/restake). It functions very well and any attack surface is very limited however. Any contributions, suggestions and ideas from the community are extremely welcome.
